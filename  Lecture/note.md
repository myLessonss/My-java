<h1>Review on the object</h1>
The only purpose of having <strong>method</strong> is to allow sharing of features(method/variables)between classes.
<h3>This is 3 types of variables:</h3>
    Instance variable{
        Any variable declared inside a class without keyword 'static'.
    }
    Class variable
    Local variable{
        Any variable declared inside a method.
    }<br>
<strong>Aconstructor:</strong>Is kind of method that is called when an object is created.
why constructor? It is created to initialize an object.
constructors???????????????????

<strong>Encapsulation</strong>is nothing but data hiding.<br>
<strong>Data:</strong>are attributes,properties or it can be variables.<br>
Every data should be private to avoid direct access on data. therefore we need public method and method
are categorized into 2:<strong>get</strong>and<strong>set</strong><br>
<strong>get</strong>:Display or retrieval info.
<strong>set</strong>:pass or sign data to method.
Squence?????????
